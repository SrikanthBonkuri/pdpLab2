The cars of the students have vehicle registration number, student registration number, first and last name of the owner, as well as the department of the student and the studentâ€™s program of study. Not all students have a car. The cars of staff have registration number, staff number, first and last name of the owner, as well as the department of work. When a student or member of staff gets a new car, the registration number of the new car is passed to the system to update the already existing record.

Demonstrate how to get car details from the standard input.
Demonstrate use of the concept of user defined packages.
Enter 5 cars of different types into the system and use an appropriate structure to hold the information and then display their details to the standard output.
Identify appropriate methods and demonstrate the concept of passing parameters by reference.
Develop a test case (or more) and use it to show that the program is running well.
Write neat code as much as you can and be organized.
Note that since no computations are being performed, the data types for the attributes can be held as of type String.
